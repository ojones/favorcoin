## Favor Coin
This is a work in progres. Favor Coin in not a fungible (ERC-20) or non-fungible token (EIP-721). Instead it is an experiment in social reputation, inside and outside of a friend group. 

## Abstract
Favor Coin is an experiment to make a platform for social favors supported by blockchain accounting.

One hypothesis is that favor coins will be most effective at the edges of normal social groups. Where people kinda know each other through someone but not really. Another hypothesis is that favor coins would be great for longterm friendships where the historical reciprocity gets hazy.

There are several factors to the experiment including transferability and minting limits. Incentive effects are a key phenomenon we wish to observe.
